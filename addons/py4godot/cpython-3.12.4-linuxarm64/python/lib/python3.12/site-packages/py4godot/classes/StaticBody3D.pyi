  """
		A static 3D physics body. It can't be moved by external forces or contacts, but can be moved manually by other means such as code, `AnimationMixer`s (with `AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process` set to `constant AnimationMixer.ANIMATION_CALLBACK_MODE_PROCESS_PHYSICS`), and `RemoteTransform3D`.
		When `StaticBody3D` is moved, it is teleported to its new position without affecting other physics bodies in its path. If this is not desired, use `AnimatableBody3D` instead.
		`StaticBody3D` is useful for completely static objects like floors and walls, as well as moving surfaces like conveyor belts and circular revolving platforms (by using `constant_linear_velocity` and `constant_angular_velocity`).
