		AudioStream that lets the user play custom streams at any time from code, simultaneously using a single player.
		Playback control is done via the `AudioStreamPlaybackPolyphonic` instance set inside the player, which can be obtained via `AudioStreamPlayer.get_stream_playback`, `AudioStreamPlayer2D.get_stream_playback` or `AudioStreamPlayer3D.get_stream_playback` methods. Obtaining the playback instance is only valid after the `stream` property is set as an `AudioStreamPolyphonic` in those players.
