  """
		A 3D ray shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a `CollisionShape3D`. When a `SeparationRayShape3D` collides with an object, it tries to separate itself from it by moving its endpoint to the collision point. For example, a `SeparationRayShape3D` next to a character can allow it to instantly move up when touching stairs.
