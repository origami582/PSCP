		This editor-only singleton returns OS-specific paths to various data folders and files. It can be used in editor plugins to ensure files are saved in the correct location on each operating system.
		**Note:** This singleton is not accessible in exported projects. Attempting to access it in an exported project will result in a script error as the singleton won't be declared. To prevent script errors in exported projects, use `Engine.has_singleton` to check whether the singleton is available before using it.
		**Note:** On the Linux/BSD platform, Godot complies with the `url=https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html`XDG Base Directory Specification`/url`. You can override environment variables following the specification to change the editor and project data paths.

				Returns `true` if the editor is marked as self-contained, `false` otherwise. When self-contained mode is enabled, user configuration, data and cache files are saved in an `editor_data/` folder next to the editor binary. This makes portable usage easier and ensures the Godot editor minimizes file writes outside its own folder. Self-contained mode is not available for exported projects.
				Self-contained mode can be enabled by creating a file named `._sc_` or `_sc_` in the same folder as the editor binary or macOS .app bundle while the editor is not running. See also `get_self_contained_file`.
				**Note:** On macOS, quarantine flag should be manually removed before using self-contained mode, see `url=https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/running_on_macos.html`Running on macOS`/url`.
				**Note:** On macOS, placing `_sc_` or any other file inside .app bundle will break digital signature and make it non-portable, consider placing it in the same folder as the .app bundle instead.
				**Note:** The Steam release of Godot uses self-contained mode by default.
