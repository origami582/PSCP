  """
		A* (A star) is a computer algorithm used in pathfinding and graph traversal, the process of plotting short paths among vertices (points), passing through a given set of edges (segments). It enjoys widespread use due to its performance and accuracy. Godot's A* implementation uses points in 3D space and Euclidean distances by default.
		You must add points manually with `add_point` and create segments manually with `connect_points`. Once done, you can test if there is a path between two points with the `are_points_connected` function, get a path containing indices by `get_id_path`, or one containing actual coordinates with `get_point_path`.
		It is also possible to use non-Euclidean distances. To do so, create a script that extends `AStar3D` and override the methods `_compute_cost` and `_estimate_cost`. Both should take two point IDs and return the distance between the corresponding points.
		**Example:** Use Manhattan distance instead of Euclidean distance:
		
		```gdscript
		class_name MyAStar3D
		extends AStar3D

		func _compute_cost(u, v):
			var u_pos = get_point_position(u)
			var v_pos = get_point_position(v)
			return abs(u_pos.x - v_pos.x) + abs(u_pos.y - v_pos.y) + abs(u_pos.z - v_pos.z)

		func _estimate_cost(u, v):
			var u_pos = get_point_position(u)
			var v_pos = get_point_position(v)
			return abs(u_pos.x - v_pos.x) + abs(u_pos.y - v_pos.y) + abs(u_pos.z - v_pos.z)
		```
		
		
		`_estimate_cost` should return a lower bound of the distance, i.e. `_estimate_cost(u, v) <= _compute_cost(u, v)`. This serves as a hint to the algorithm because the custom `_compute_cost` might be computation-heavy. If this is not the case, make `_estimate_cost` return the same value as `_compute_cost` to provide the algorithm with the most accurate information.
		If the default `_estimate_cost` and `_compute_cost` methods are used, or if the supplied `_estimate_cost` method returns a lower bound of the cost, then the paths returned by A* will be the lowest-cost paths. Here, the cost of a path equals the sum of the `_compute_cost` results of all segments in the path multiplied by the `weight_scale`s of the endpoints of the respective segments. If the default methods are used and the `weight_scale`s of all points are set to `1.0`, then this equals the sum of Euclidean distances of all segments in the path.
