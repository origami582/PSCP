		`CheckButton` is a toggle button displayed as a check field. It's similar to `CheckBox` in functionality, but it has a different appearance. To follow established UX patterns, it's recommended to use `CheckButton` when toggling it has an **immediate** effect on something. For example, it can be used when pressing it shows or hides advanced settings, without asking the user to confirm this action.
		See also `BaseButton` which contains common properties and methods associated with this node.
