  """
		`CheckBox` allows the user to choose one of only two possible options. It's similar to `CheckButton` in functionality, but it has a different appearance. To follow established UX patterns, it's recommended to use `CheckBox` when toggling it has **no** immediate effect on something. For example, it could be used when toggling it will only do something once a confirmation button is pressed.
		See also `BaseButton` which contains common properties and methods associated with this node.
		When `BaseButton.button_group` specifies a `ButtonGroup`, `CheckBox` changes its appearance to that of a radio button and uses the various `radio_*` theme properties.
