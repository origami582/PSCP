  """
		A 3D cylinder shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a `CollisionShape3D`.
		**Note:** There are several known bugs with cylinder collision shapes. Using `CapsuleShape3D` or `BoxShape3D` instead is recommended.
		**Performance:** `CylinderShape3D` is fast to check collisions against, but it is slower than `CapsuleShape3D`, `BoxShape3D`, and `SphereShape3D`.
