		Creates a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) tree structure around triangle geometry.
		The triangle BVH tree can be used for efficient intersection queries without involving a physics engine.
		For example, this can be used in editor tools to select objects with complex shapes based on the mouse cursor position.
		**Performance:** Creating the BVH tree for complex geometry is a slow process and best done in a background thread.
