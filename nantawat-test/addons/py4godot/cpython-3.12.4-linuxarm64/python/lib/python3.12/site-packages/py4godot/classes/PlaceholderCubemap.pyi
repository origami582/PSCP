		This class replaces a `Cubemap` or a `Cubemap`-derived class in 2 conditions:
		- In dedicated server mode, where the image data shouldn't affect game logic. This allows reducing the exported PCK's size significantly.
		- When the `Cubemap`-derived class is missing, for example when using a different engine version.
		**Note:** This class is not intended for rendering or for use in shaders. Operations like calculating UV are not guaranteed to work.
