		A resource to add to an `AnimationNodeBlendTree`. Blends two animations out of three linearly out of three based on the amount value.
		This animation node has three inputs:
		- The base animation to blend with
		- A "-blend" animation to blend with when the blend amount is negative value
		- A "+blend" animation to blend with when the blend amount is positive value
		In general, the blend value should be in the ``-1.0, 1.0`` range. Values outside of this range can blend amplified animations, however, `AnimationNodeAdd3` works better for this purpose.
