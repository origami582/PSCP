		See also `ResourceImporterOBJ`, which is used for OBJ models that can be imported as an independent `Mesh` or a scene.
		Additional options (such as extracting individual meshes or materials to files) are available in the **Advanced Import Settings** dialog. This dialog can be accessed by double-clicking a 3D scene in the FileSystem dock or by selecting a 3D scene in the FileSystem dock, going to the Import dock and choosing **Advanced**.
		**Note:** `ResourceImporterScene` is _not_ used for `PackedScene`s, such as `.tscn` and `.scn` files.
